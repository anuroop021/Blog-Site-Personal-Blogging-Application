# Description:
The Personal Blogging Application project is a web application that I developed to showcase my proficiency in full-stack web development. This platform allows users to create, write, and publish their own blogs, providing a user-friendly and dynamic environment for content creation and sharing. 

# Key Technologies Used:

# Key Features:
1. User Registration and Authentication: The platform includes user registration and login functionality to enable users to create and manage their own blogs.

2. Blog Creation and Editing: Users can easily create, edit, and format their blogs using a user-friendly interface.

3. Blog Publishing: Once blogs are created and edited, users can publish them for the public to view.

4. Blog Listing and Display: The platform provides a clean and organized layout for listing and displaying published blogs, making it easy for readers to explore the content.

5. Responsive Design: The use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ensures that the platform is responsive and accessible on various devices, including mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.

6. Database Integration: MongoDB is used to store and manage blog data, ensuring data persistence and efficient retrieval.

7. User-friendly UI: EJS templates are employed to create dynamic and user-friendly web pages, enhancing the overall user experience.

This project demonstrates my skills in building a functional web application with a focus on both the frontend and backend aspects. It showcases my ability to create a fully responsive and interactive web platform using a popular tech stack.
